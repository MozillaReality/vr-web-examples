## VR Web Examples

A collection of boilerplate web VR scenes from the Mozilla Research VR team. For additional demos, tutorials and resources, visit [mozvr.com](http://mozvr.com)

* [Basic Three.js VR boilerplate](http://mozvr.github.io/vr-web-examples/threejs-vr-boilerplate/)
* [Mockups on cylinders](http://mozvr.github.io/vr-web-examples/mockups-on-cylinders/)

To view these examples in virtual reality mode requires a VR-enabled browser and a compatible headset. Currently the Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2 are supported, with support for additional devices coming soon.
